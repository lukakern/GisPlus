This repository contains the work on a project/task of a 3 weeks course module GIS+ from the Faculty of Environmental and Natural Resources, University of Freiburg, Germany.

The task was to write a function 'rasterizer' which will turn a list of geometries into a 2D numpy array. The user should at least be able to pass the cell size to your function.
